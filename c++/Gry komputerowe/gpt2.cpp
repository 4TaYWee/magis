Creating a full-fledged platform or arcade game in C++ from scratch, including graphics, collision handling, animations, and sounds, would be quite an extensive task to cover fully in this format. However, I can provide you with a basic outline and some code snippets to get you started. For the sake of simplicity, let's create a basic platformer game using the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library for graphics, audio, and input handling.

First, make sure you have SDL installed and set up in your development environment. Then, you can begin by structuring your code into different modules, such as main game loop, player, level, collision detection, etc.

Here's a basic outline of what your code might look like:

```cpp
  */
#include <SDL2/SDL.h>
#include <iostream>

// Constants
const int SCREEN_WIDTH = 800;
const int SCREEN_HEIGHT = 600;
const int PLAYER_WIDTH = 50;
const int PLAYER_HEIGHT = 50;
const int GRAVITY = 1;
const int JUMP_FORCE = 15;
const int GROUND_HEIGHT = SCREEN_HEIGHT - 100;

// Player class
class Player {
public:
    int x, y;
    int velX, velY;
    bool isJumping;

    Player() {
        x = SCREEN_WIDTH / 2 - PLAYER_WIDTH / 2;
        y = GROUND_HEIGHT - PLAYER_HEIGHT;
        velX = 0;
        velY = 0;
        isJumping = false;
    }

    void handleInput(SDL_Event& event) {
        if (event.type == SDL_KEYDOWN && event.key.keysym.sym == SDLK_SPACE && !isJumping) {
            isJumping = true;
            velY = -JUMP_FORCE;
        }
    }

    void update() {
        // Apply gravity
        velY += GRAVITY;
        // Update position
        x += velX;
        y += velY;
        // Check if the player is on the ground
        if (y >= GROUND_HEIGHT - PLAYER_HEIGHT) {
            y = GROUND_HEIGHT - PLAYER_HEIGHT;
            velY = 0;
            isJumping = false;
        }
    }
};

// Main function
int main() {
    SDL_Window* window;
    SDL_Renderer* renderer;
    bool isRunning = true;
    SDL_Event event;

    // Initialize SDL
    if (SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO) < 0) {
        std::cerr << "SDL could not initialize! SDL_Error: " << SDL_GetError() << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // Create window
    window = SDL_CreateWindow("Platformer Game", SDL_WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED, SDL_WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED, SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT, SDL_WINDOW_SHOWN);
    if (window == nullptr) {
        std::cerr << "Window could not be created! SDL_Error: " << SDL_GetError() << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // Create renderer
    renderer = SDL_CreateRenderer(window, -1, SDL_RENDERER_ACCELERATED);
    if (renderer == nullptr) {
        std::cerr << "Renderer could not be created! SDL_Error: " << SDL_GetError() << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // Initialize player
    Player player;

    // Main game loop
    while (isRunning) {
        // Event handling
        while (SDL_PollEvent(&event)) {
            if (event.type == SDL_QUIT) {
                isRunning = false;
            }
            player.handleInput(event);
        }

        // Update
        player.update();

        // Clear screen
        SDL_SetRenderDrawColor(renderer, 0, 0, 0, 255);
        SDL_RenderClear(renderer);

        // Render player
        SDL_Rect playerRect = {player.x, player.y, PLAYER_WIDTH, PLAYER_HEIGHT};
        SDL_SetRenderDrawColor(renderer, 255, 255, 255, 255);
        SDL_RenderFillRect(renderer, &playerRect);

        // Render present
        SDL_RenderPresent(renderer);
    }

    // Cleanup
    SDL_DestroyRenderer(renderer);
    SDL_DestroyWindow(window);
    SDL_Quit();

    return 0;
}

```

This code creates a simple window with a white rectangle representing the player. You can extend this by adding more features such as platforms, enemies, animations, and sounds as you progress with your game development. Additionally, you may want to use SDL's image loading functions for handling sprites, and SDL_mixer for audio playback. Remember to handle collisions between the player and other objects in your game world as well.
